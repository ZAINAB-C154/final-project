  <h1>Diabetes</h1>
  <p>
     diabetes, polyuria, and others (in Latin: Diabetes mellitus) is a syndrome characterized by a metabolic disorder and abnormal high blood sugar levels caused by insulin deficiency, decreased tissue sensitivity to insulin, or both. Diabetes leads to serious complications or even premature death. However, diabetics can take certain steps to control the disease and reduce the risk of complications. These steps are to reduce weight and exercise.

     Diabetics have problems converting food into metabolic (metabolic) energy. After eating a meal, the carbohydrates in it are broken down into a sugar called glucose, which the blood transfers to all cells of the body to take advantage of it and produce energy. Most cells in the body need insulin to allow glucose from the blood and the intercellular medium into the cells. If the consumption of food rich in sugar and carbohydrates is large, the liver and pancreas are unable to produce enough insulin to enter the sugar into the cells, and part of the sugar remains in the blood. This is type 2 diabetes.
 
     Diabetes does not convert glucose into energy. This leads to the availability of excess quantities of it in the blood, while the cells remain hungry for energy. Over the years, a state of hyperglycemia develops (in Latin: hyperglycemia), which causes severe damage to nerves and blood vessels, and thus this can lead to complications such as heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, diabetic neuropathy, gum infections, diabetic foot, and even can That it comes to amputation.
 
     As for the symptoms that suggest this disease, they are an increase in the number of times urinating due to polyuria (an increase in the amount of urine) that results from high osmotic pressure, an increase in the sense of thirst and resulting in increased fluid intake to try to compensate for increased urination, severe and general fatigue, weight loss despite eating regularly, Greater appetite, slower wound healing, and blurred vision. These symptoms are less severe if the high blood sugar concentration is slight, meaning that there is a direct correlation between these symptoms and blood sugar. You can reduce blood sugar by reducing the intake of soft drinks and processed juices, and by reducing the intake of complex carbohydrates such as pastries, pies and sweets; And movement (such as walking and exercise) helps to consume sugar in the blood.
